//! The transport-agnostic stream a proxy connection rides, and the two roles that produce
//! one: a listener that accepts it and a dialer that connects it.
//!
//! Until now the app spoke `std::net::TcpStream` end to end, so a config naming a Unix
//! domain socket had nowhere to bind or dial. `Connection` is the seam that lets an `AF_UNIX`
//! stream stand in for a TCP one wherever a connection is carried: it forwards the reads,
//! writes and half-closes the relay needs, keeps the same read and write timeouts the engine
//! arms a leg with, and — because `TCP_NODELAY` has no socket analogue — makes the no-delay
//! request a documented no-op on a Unix stream rather than a silent failure.
//!
//! The Unix arm is built on both host families that name a socket path in a config. On a Unix
//! host it is `std`'s `UnixStream`; on Windows `std` has the type but keeps it behind the
//! unstable `windows_unix_domain_sockets` feature, which a stable build cannot name, so there the
//! same arm is a `SOCK_STREAM` socket in the `AF_UNIX` family, opened and driven through
//! `WinSock` (`winunix` below) the way `std` drives its own sockets. What neither host gives for
//! free is carried by the seam: `std` has no timeout setter for a Unix stream at all, and
//! `WinSock` spells the wait bound in milliseconds rather than a `timeval`. The `SOCK_STREAM`
//! shape and the Windows 10 build 17063 floor are the ones `std`'s own Windows unix module names.
